# Features

# Installation

### Node and NPM
The project uses Node Version Manager (NVM) as a tool for managing Node versions on the device.
* Install nvm
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
```
* Use NVM to install Node version v16.20.1 and NPM version 8.19.4
```
nvm install node v16.20.1
```
- Verify installation ``` node -v ``` and ```npm -v ```

### Nextjs

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
