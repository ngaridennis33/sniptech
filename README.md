# Next.js Project: Client and Admin Folders

This repository contains a Next.js project with separate `client` and `admin` folders. These folders serve distinct purposes within the project.

## Client

The `client` folder houses the frontend portion of the application. It is responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and communicating with the backend APIs or services. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in the `client` folder:

- **Pages**: This is where you define the routes and views of your application. Each `.js` or `.jsx` file within the `pages` directory corresponds to a unique route. You can create dynamic and static pages using Next.js's powerful routing system.

- **Components**: Place reusable UI components here. These components can be shared across multiple pages, enhancing consistency and maintainability.

- **Styles**: Store your global styles, CSS modules, or styling libraries like SCSS or styled-components in this directory.

- **Public**: Static assets such as images, fonts, and other files can be placed here. They will be accessible directly via URL.

- **Utils**: Utility functions, helper methods, or constants can be organized in this directory for better code organization.

## Admin

The `admin` folder is dedicated to the administrative panel or backend management of the application. It handles tasks such as managing users, content, settings, and other administrative functions. Here's what you'll typically find in the `admin` folder:

- **Pages**: Similar to the `client` folder, this is where you can define administrative routes and views. These routes are separate from the client-facing routes and are designed for internal use.

- **Components**: Admin-specific components that are used to build the admin UI can be placed here. These components might differ in styling and functionality from those in the `client` folder.

- **APIs**: Backend API calls or integrations related to the administrative functions of the application can be managed in this directory.

- **Auth**: If the admin panel requires authentication, you might find authentication-related code or components here.

- **Styles**: Admin-specific styles or styling overrides can be stored in this directory.

Remember that the separation of concerns between the `client` and `admin` folders helps maintain a clean and organized codebase. Each folder serves a distinct purpose, making it easier to manage and scale your Next.js project.
